# Changing and Reading metadata of PDF


Once, when I edited and downloaded my CV from Canva, I encountered an unexpected issue: the title of the PDF file remained the same, making it seem unprofessional. Despite my attempts to edit it locally, I couldn't find a straightforward solution. Frustrated by this inconvenience, I sought a workaround and eventually turned to online platforms for editing metadata. However, this experience inspired me to take matters into my own hands and develop a solution tailored to my needs. Leveraging the power of ```tkinter``` and ```PyPDF2```, I embarked on creating a tool to efficiently manage PDF metadata. This project not only addressed my initial problem but also empowered me to proactively solve similar challenges in the future.
